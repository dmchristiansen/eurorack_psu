# eurorack_psu

This is a simple power supply board for a eurorack setup.

The PSU takes 12VAC input and provides +/-12V and 5V DC.
The plug, switch, and indicator leds are off-board (either a panel or case)

The bus board is supplied by the spade connectors from the PSU and provides multiple 16-pin headers.
